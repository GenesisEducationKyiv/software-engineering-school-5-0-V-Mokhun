# ADR-002: Introduce Notification Microservice

## Context

The current application handles sending notifications (currently, only emails) from within the main monolithic service. While this logic is processed via background jobs using a Redis queue (BullMQ), the workers themselves run as part of the main application process. This couples the core business logic with the concerns of notification delivery.

As we anticipate future requirements for additional notification channels (e.g., SMS, Telegram) and aim for a more resilient and scalable architecture, we need to decouple this distinct piece of functionality. Sending notifications is a self-contained capability that does not need to be tied to the core application's deployment and scaling lifecycle.

## Decision

We will extract all notification-related logic into a new, separate microservice named the **Notification Service**.

1.  **Responsibility**: This service will be solely responsible for processing and sending all user-facing notifications. Initially, this will only include emails.
2.  **Communication**: The communication between the `Main App` and the `Notification Service` will be asynchronous, utilizing the existing Redis/BullMQ infrastructure as a message bus.
3.  **Workflow**:
    - The `Main App` will publish "notification jobs" (e.g., `SEND_WEATHER_UPDATE_EMAIL`) to the Redis queue.
    - The `Notification Service` will contain the BullMQ workers that subscribe to these queues, process the jobs, and interact with the necessary third-party API providers (e.g., SendGrid).
    - The `Main App` will no longer host workers for these queues.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Increased Resilience**: The `Main App`'s ability to serve user requests is no longer directly impacted by the availability of third-party notification providers. It only needs to successfully queue a job in Redis.
- **Improved Scalability**: The `Notification Service` can be scaled independently. If we experience a high volume of outgoing notifications, we can increase the instances of this service without scaling the entire `Main App`.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The `Main App`'s codebase is simplified. It becomes responsible for _triggering_ notifications, but not for the implementation details of _how_ they are sent, formatted, or handled.
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: The chosen design provides a clear and easy path for introducing new notification channels with zero changes required in the `Main App`.

### Negative

- **Increased Operational Complexity**: We will have an additional service to deploy, monitor, and maintain. This introduces overhead for CI/CD, logging, and alerting.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: While resilient, debugging a single notification flow becomes more complex as it spans across two services and a message bus. Distributed tracing will become more important.
- **Infrastructure Dependency**: The system's overall health becomes more critically dependent on the availability and performance of the Redis message bus.
- **Delayed Feedback**: The `Main App` only gets confirmation that a notification job was successfully _queued_, not that it was successfully _sent_. This is an acceptable trade-off for almost all notification use cases.
